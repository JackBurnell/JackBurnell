- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m not @JackBurnell, but its the name Im using.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in freedom, programming.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ..everything Ive missed in the last 25 years. so..everything.
- I started programming in 1977 with Z-80 asm.
my job was configuring/repairing mini (refrigerator sized) computers,
terminals, long haul, modems, multiplexors,etc. Basically everything
associated with PICK OS and time-sharing. I did as
we all do and had continued learning languages. Smalltalk, lisp, all the BASICS, Pascal, C, etc.
I basically bailed from society in 92. I was quite good and in demand for my  dual electronic/ programming skills
back in the day and did some notable projects all alone. From
hacking port dongles to building real time electronic interfaces and programming.
Living in a literal
shack in the woods. I didnt see a tv or electronic
device except in the grocery store for...forever.
I had some major heart attacks and had
to choose die alone in the woods and let vermin
feed on my rotting corpse or come in. I came in.
The world has gone insane. Guys think theyre girls,
the government openly violating every right
we have, planned and organized genocide
of US citizens via pharmacia, communists parading
..whatever. I should have stayed in the
  woods because Im too old to lead or fighta rebellion.
  But the die is cast and Im here. With nothing but an Android phone.
  I saw some Javascript source code and was impressed.
  It was a data feeder for web pages when I last saw it.
  I cant find Javascript to run on my phone, and
  the Termux/Python thing uses too many resources. But I really miss programming.
  I have Droidscript, which is garbage, and the creators act
  like a fkn secret society that wont tell
  you shit unless you know tbe handshake and pay a monthly fee..
  but its all I have.
  Its kinda Javascript but I have no bank account and no electronic
  payment means...and Im not getting any. see World has gone insane.
  So basically, using Android, the devils OS, and Droidscript
  just to do something I used to love while
  Im waiting to die. Living with an old 1% biker that I  used to run with before the
  and his wife. They, and absolutely nobody thatvisits knows
  a single thing about computers or even
  that its programming that makes them run.  I wrote a voice controlled
  camera app a while back and tried to show them how clean and  concise
  the code was.  Theyre like...download that for me.
  Might as well be showing a monkey quadratic equations.
  Not sure if being devoid of technology totally
  or getting some with nobody to talk to is worse.
  Anyway, thats not my story, just the abridged relevant
  one for here and now. 
  Zero  income, no computer, one living friend, starting fresh on
  not my favorite OS and language.  I will say this.
  While theres absolutely nothing here on Droidscript that any
  idiot should be able to learn in short order, I love it that smart people
  here share their code and experience. This is new to me.
  This and StackOverflow are the reason I was
  able to learn what little I have about Javascript and Android.
  So thank you all.
