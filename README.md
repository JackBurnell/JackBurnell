- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m not @JackBurnell, but its the name Im using.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in freedom, programming .
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ..everything Ive missed in the last 25 years. so..everything relevant. 
- 
I started programming in 1976 with Z-80 ASM and over the years have run the gamut from all the BASICs including S and C-BASIC, Turbo Pascal from v1 for CP/M to Delphi Architect, Prolog, on and on, until  I  got into  C but  got sidetracked for 20 years flat. I tried to keep learning from books and writing code on toilet paper but  had no computer. I wrote beautiful code...but could only  presume it would compile and run. 

Im old now but am learning Javascript. I never had any interest in it because last I checked. I guess i   the mid 90s  it was just a dats engine for HTML. How things have changed. Very powerful and easy language..mostly. I just wanted to knock out
some Android apps and dont have a reliable computer or a place to keep one safely so Im  using Dtoidscript on a phone. And honestly, Im not as sharp as I used to be and dont want to have to learn JSON,CSS, Node, React or buy a power PC to run Android Studio. But if I could, Id do it and ditch  this Droidscript for Kotlin in a heartbeat It is what it is though and Im sleeping in the bed I made.

So Im just here to study and dont imagine Ill live long enough to contribute much. I have used Droidscript since Christmas 23 though and have written probably 100 or so short projects, so who knows. We shall see.
